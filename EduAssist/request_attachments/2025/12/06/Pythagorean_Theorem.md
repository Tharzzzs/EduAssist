**Core Concept:** The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.

**Statement:** In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle, denoted as 'c') is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two## Pythagorean Theorem Summary

**Core Concept:** The Pythagorean Theorem describes the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.

**Statement:** In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle, denoted as 'c') is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (legs, denoted as 'a' and 'b').

**Formula:** a² + b² = c²

**Application:**
